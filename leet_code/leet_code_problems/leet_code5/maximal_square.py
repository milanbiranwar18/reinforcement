# Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
# Output: 4
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
# Output: 1
# Example 3:
#
# Input: matrix = [["0"]]
# Output: 0
