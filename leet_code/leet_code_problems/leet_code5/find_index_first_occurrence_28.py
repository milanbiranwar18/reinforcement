# Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle
# is not part of haystack.
# Example 1:
#
# Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
# The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
# Output: -1
# Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
